My team and I have developed, and are continuing to develop new monitoring devices and sofware for the global energy sector. The purpose is to deliver real time information on energy use and projected use all over the globe. Currently, we monitor for governmental and private entities, and are on the front lines of information gathering when it comes to the energy market.

For these projects, I am one of 4 developers worldwide that creates new technologies based on global demand.
